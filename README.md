# CSV to PDF converter

With CSV file , iText API is used to write CSV data to a PDF file. (This is a Java 17 project built with Gradle. Build in your IDE before running _Main.Java_)

Ensure that the CSV file is named `input.csv` and placed at under the _resources_ folder. The PDF will be generated as `output.pdf` in the _resources_ folder. 
Alternatively, you can edit the `INPUT` and `OUTPUT` variables in _Main.java_.
